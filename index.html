			<div id="row">
			<div class="item"><h3>Ahoy/ahoy there!</h3> - A satisfyingly piratical alternative greeting.</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Arr</h3> – All pirates use this interspersed throughout dialogue to sound more pirate-y. Meaning is context-dependent. Examples include: ‘Arr, this be a fine hoard o’ doubloons!’ or ‘Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrhoy!’</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Avast</h3> – Look out/attention! Usually used to alert the crew to impending danger. Often accompanied by wild gesticulation for the greatest effect.</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Bilge rat</h3> – A general pirate insult. The bilge wasn’t the nicest place to be on a ship…</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Board ‘em!</h3> – Exclaimed when boarding any enemy ship. Just in case no-one follows your lead and end up on a hostile ship alone, it’s best to shout this as loud as you can before swinging across.</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Booty</h3> – Plunder, treasure, spoils of war. Often takes the guise of gold coins or Doubloons.</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Grog</h3> – An alcoholic beverage to wet yer whistle. Normally rum, although any rum-based cocktail is also acceptable on some pirate ships.</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Jolly boat</h3> – A small rowing boat attached to the ship. Can be used for navigating up shallow rivers or, if you’re careful, having a quick snooze without anyone noticing.</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Jolly Roger</h3> – The pirate flag! Can be any design, though they predominantly have black or red backgrounds. Popular choices for the discerning pirate captain include a skull and crossbones, or skeleton with a cutlass.</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Land ho!</h3> – Signalling the sighting of land on the horizon, usually shouted from the Crow’s Nest. It’s a good idea to point emphatically in the right direction when using this phrase, to avoid general confusion and unnecessary squinting.</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Landlubber</h3> – An insult for a person rather inexperienced with being at sea. Appropriate uses would be: ‘What are you doing there, you festering landlubber?!’ or ‘That landlubber’s only gone and scuttled me ship!’</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Matey</h3> – A somewhat affectionate term for someone, usually when conversing with them. An example would be: ‘Arr matey, that’s a fine barrel of grog ye got there.’</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Scurvy dog</h3> – Another piratical insult. Scurvy, a disease caused by lack of Vitamin C, was really not something you wanted miles out to sea with limited medical treatment on offer.</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Scuttle</h3> – to sink something, usually your ship.</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Shipmate</h3> – A member of your good-for-nothing pirate crew. </div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Tharr she blows!</h3> – Generally used to alert your crew to the presence of a surfacing whale.</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>The Pirate Code</h3> – A group of rules or articles to provide guidance on things like discipline, booty and voting rights. Can often be cited to provide explanation for misdemeanours e.g. ‘I acted in accordance with the Code, you landlubber!’ or ‘But according to Article 18, them’s that falls behind, stays behind.’</div>
			<div class="item"><h3>Walk the plank</h3> – Force a treacherous bilge rat to walk over a short plank and subsequently fall into the sea.</div>

			<div id="tip">
				<div class="tipitem"><h3>1. Act as if you own the place. Voice your opinions loudly and with confidence. All pirates swagger as they walk, exuding an astonishingly brazen self-assurance.</h3></div>
				<div class="tipitem"><h3>2. Change yer accent. Drop the v’s and g’s in words; for instance, ‘never going’ would become ‘ne’er goin’. Exchange ‘you’ and ‘your’ for ‘ye’ and ‘yer’. Add the occasional ‘arr!’ in there and you’re good to go.</h3></div>
				<div class="tipitem"><h3>3. Gesticulate wildly. Pirates affirm their confident opinions with equally confident actions. When asking for another drink, slam your tankard down on the bar to attract attention as you loudly exclaim: ‘Barkeep! Another round of grog for me and the crew!’</h3></div>
				<div class="tipitem"><h3>4. Say things like ‘arr’ and ‘matey’ a lot. These are crucial elements of a piratical dialogue and, combined with the appropriate accent and actions, will confirm that you are a proper pirate. If you have to laugh during a conversation, make sure it’s a hearty guffaw, preferably while slapping someone on the back and/or knocking over a drink.</h3></div>
